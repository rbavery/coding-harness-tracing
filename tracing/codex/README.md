# Codex CLI Tracing

Automatic [OpenInference](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference) tracing for the OpenAI Codex CLI. Spans are exported to [Arize AX](https://arize.com) or [Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix).

## Setup
The installer prompts for your backend (Phoenix or Arize AX) and project name, writes credentials to `~/.arize/harness/config.json`, and registers the hook entries plus the `notify` token-usage backstop in `~/.codex/config.toml`. After installing, approve the hooks via Codex's `/hooks` command (one time per user account).

Pass `--with-skills` to also symlink the `manage-codex-tracing` skill into the current directory's `.agents/skills/` so coding agents in this workspace can help manage Codex tracing configuration.

### Existing notification commands

If `notify` already contains a command, the installer preserves it using `--previous-notify` chaining. Recognized Codex desktop callbacks remain outermost. Reinstall keeps a single Arize callback; uninstall restores the previous command.

The rollout reader also recognizes user prompts stored as `response_item` messages. When content provenance is available, it excludes injected repository instructions and environment content.

### Pause and resume exports

After installing the bug-bash fork, run these commands in Terminal:

```sh
bash ~/.arize/harness/install.sh pause codex
bash ~/.arize/harness/install.sh resume codex
bash ~/.arize/harness/install.sh trace-status codex
```

Pause and resume apply to all chats using your Codex home. The hook reads the
switch at each completed turn, so you do not need to restart Codex. An export
already in progress may finish. Updating the installer preserves a paused state.
These commands do not delete existing Phoenix traces or Codex transcripts.

The package also installs `codex-tracing off`, `on`, and `status` in
`~/.arize/harness/venv/bin`. The shell commands above do not require a PATH change.

To stop acceptance from Phoenix, an admin can revoke the participant's dedicated
system API key in Settings. Resume requires a replacement key. Local resume cannot
restore a revoked key.

cd coding-harness-tracing
```

**macOS / Linux**

Uninstall:

```powershell
install.bat uninstall codex
```

## Default Settings

| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| Harness key | `codex` |
| Project name | `codex` |
| Phoenix endpoint | `http://localhost:6006` |
| Arize AX endpoint | `otlp.arize.com:443` |
| Hook config file | `~/.codex/config.toml` |
| Hook events handled | `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `Stop` (via real Codex hooks); `agent-turn-complete` (via `notify`) for token usage |
| Env override file | `~/.codex/arize-env.sh` |
| State directory | `~/.arize/harness/state/codex/` (state files + tool span JSONLs) |
| Log file | `~/.arize/harness/logs/codex.log` |

## Trust prompt

Codex requires explicit user trust for non-managed hooks before they fire. After install, run:

1. `codex` (start a session)
2. Type `/hooks` and approve each `arize-hook-codex-*` entry.

Without this one-time approval, hooks won't fire and traces will be limited to the `notify`-based fallback (single LLM span per turn, no tool spans).

## Verifying tracing

Run any Codex command:

```bash
codex exec "explain what this file does" path/to/file.py
```

Then check:

- Hook activity in `~/.arize/harness/logs/codex.log`.
- Per-thread state files in `~/.arize/harness/state/codex/` show recent activity.
- Spans appear in your configured project in Arize AX or Phoenix.

Errors are always logged. For routine hook activity, add `export ARIZE_VERBOSE=true` to `~/.codex/arize-env.sh` (or your shell) and re-run. See the [main README's Environment variables section](../../README.md#environment-variables) for the full list of runtime overrides (`ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED`, `ARIZE_DRY_RUN`, `ARIZE_TRACE_DEBUG`, etc.).

## Troubleshooting

**Hooks not firing.** Run `codex` → `/hooks` and confirm the `arize-hook-codex-*` entries are listed and trusted. If they aren't listed at all, re-run the installer.

**No spans appear.** Re-source your shell profile (or open a new terminal) so `~/.codex/arize-env.sh` is loaded. Check `~/.arize/harness/logs/codex.log` for backend/auth errors. Confirm the hooks are trusted via `/hooks`.

**Disable temporarily.** Untrust the entries via `codex` → `/hooks`, or set `ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED=false` in `~/.codex/arize-env.sh` and restart Codex. Full uninstall: `./install.sh uninstall codex`.
